# DataAnalysis-Project_02
Data cleaning is the main part of Data analysis. I used here a housing data. Here are some column which are important for queries but not cleaned. So, for make useable I just 
cleaned it by using SSMS.
One thing should be done carefully when drop or delete something from main database. So before deleting something try to avoid main data,instead use temporary data or table.
